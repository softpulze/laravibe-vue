# Laravel + Vue Starter Kit

## Introduction

Our Vue starter kit provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a Vue frontend using [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com).

Inertia allows you to build modern, single-page Vue applications using classic server-side routing and controllers. This lets you enjoy the frontend power of Vue combined with the incredible backend productivity of Laravel and lightning-fast Vite compilation.

This Vue starter kit utilizes Vue 3 and the Composition API, TypeScript, Tailwind, and the [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com) component library.
