## Introduction

LaraVibe-Vue is an open-source starter kit that combines the backend power of **Laravel 13** with a fully typed **Vue 3** frontend via **Inertia.js v3** — giving you a modern SPA feel without sacrificing the simplicity of classic server-side routing and controllers.

Out of the box you get authentication, account management, an administration area, SSR support, type-safe route helpers, and a curated set of developer tooling — all wired together and ready to go.

---

## Tech Stack

Every package in this stack was chosen deliberately. Nothing is here for show — each one earns its place by solving a real problem well.

### Core

The backbone. These three working together is what makes LaraVibe-Vue feel different from a traditional Laravel app or a standalone SPA.

| Package                             | Version | Why it's here                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Laravel](https://laravel.com)      | 13      | The application framework — routing, ORM, auth, jobs, mail, and everything in between       |
| [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com) | 3       | The bridge — write server-side controllers, get a full SPA on the frontend, no API required |

| [Lucide Vue](https://lucide.dev)             | latest  | Clean, consistent icon library with tree-shaking out of the box                           |
| [vue-sonner](https://vue-sonner.vercel.app)  | 2       | The Vue renderer behind the built-in toast notification system                            |

The structured conventions and documented architecture mean AI agents can read, understand, and contribute confidently.

#### 🛠️ Developer Tooling — Full Power, Zero Configuration

Most starter kits leave you to wire up your own code quality tools. LaraVibe-Vue ships with a **complete, pre-configured professional toolchain** — the same setup senior engineers spend days assembling on real projects, ready to go from your very first commit.

| Tool                       | What it does                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pest 4**                 | Expressive, readable PHP tests — the best testing experience in the Laravel ecosystem     |
| **Larastan (PHPStan lv9)** | Catches bugs before they reach production — static analysis tuned for Laravel             |
| **Laravel Pint**           | Zero-config PHP code formatter — your code always looks clean, always                     |
| **Rector**                 | Automated PHP refactoring and upgrades — keeps your codebase modern without manual effort |
| **ESLint 9**               | Lints your TypeScript and Vue files with a flat config that just works                    |
| **Prettier 3**             | Frontend formatting on save — consistent style across every `.vue` and `.ts` file         |

Everything is wired into composer scripts so the whole team uses the same workflow. One command before you push — `composer review` — and you know your code is clean, typed, formatted, and tested. No arguments, no setup, no excuses.

> New team member? They get the full toolchain the moment they clone the repo. Senior dev? Nothing to configure. It's already right.

#### ⚡ Type-Safe Routing with Laravel Wayfinder

Tired of hardcoded URLs breaking silently? **Wayfinder auto-generates fully-typed TypeScript functions** for every controller action and named route — straight from your PHP code into your Vue components. It runs automatically during `composer dev` and `npm run build`, so your frontend and backend are always in sync.

```vue
<!-- No more magic strings. Just types. -->
<Link :href="AccountController.edit().url()">My Account</Link>
```

#### 🖥️ SSR Out of the Box

Server-side rendering is configured and ready. Powered by `@inertiajs/vite` in cluster mode, your app serves fast initial HTML to every visitor — great for SEO and perceived performance — without any extra setup on your part.

#### 🎨 shadcn-vue UI Components

Pre-configured via `components.json` with **Reka UI** as the headless base. Beautiful, accessible, unstyled-by-default components you can drop in and style with Tailwind. Add new components with a single command:

```bash
npx shadcn-vue@latest add button
```

#### 🍞 Toast Notifications — Architected, Not Hacked In

The toast system is a first-class citizen, not an afterthought. It has its own service layer, typed DTOs, and a Vue renderer that handles every case. Trigger toasts from anywhere on the backend with a single helper:

```php
toastSuccess('Profile updated.');
toastError('Something went wrong.');
```

See [app/Toast/README.md](app/Toast/README.md) for the full architecture and usage guide.

#### 🔑 Auth Composable — No Prop Drilling

Access the authenticated user anywhere in Vue without passing props down the tree. The `useAuth` composable gives you everything you need:

```ts
const { user, isAuthenticated, can, requireUser } = useAuth()
```

- `user` — the current user or `null` for guests
- `requireUser()` — non-null user on protected pages, no optional-chaining noise
- `can('publishPost')` — UI gating backed by real server-side ability checks
- `isAuthenticated` — boolean flag for conditional rendering

See [resources/composables/README.md](resources/composables/README.md) for the full guide.

#### 🧱 Structured Architecture You'll Actually Enjoy

Every part of the app has a clear home and a convention to follow — documented with READMEs so your whole team stays consistent:

| Layer              | Purpose                                                | Docs                                   |

## Requirements

- PHP **8.4+**
- Composer
- Node.js **20+** & npm
- SQLite / MySQL / PostgreSQL

---

## Installation

### 1. Create the project

If you have the [Laravel CLI installer](https://laravel.com/docs/installation#the-laravel-installer) installed, this is the fastest way to get started:

```bash
laravel new my-app --using=softpulze/laravibe-vue
cd my-app
```

Prefer Composer? This works equally well:

```bash
composer create-project softpulze/laravibe-vue my-app
cd my-app
```

Or clone the repository directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/softpulze/laravibe-vue.git my-app
cd my-app
cp .env.example .env
composer install
php artisan key:generate
```

### 2. Configure your environment

Edit `.env` and set your database connection (SQLite is the default):

```env
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
# DB_CONNECTION=mysql
# DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
# DB_DATABASE=laravibe
# DB_USERNAME=root
# DB_PASSWORD=
```

Set your application URL and mail settings as needed.

### 3. Run migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 4. Install frontend dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Start the development server

```bash
composer dev
```

This starts Vite, queue listener, and Pail log watcher concurrently.

If you are using Laravel Herd, open your local Herd URL (for example: `https://my-app.test`).
If you are not using Herd, run `php artisan serve` in another terminal.

---

## Available Scripts

Everything you need for your daily workflow is a single command away. No need to remember a chain of tools, flags, or file paths — just use the script that matches what you're doing right now.

### Starting development

```bash
composer dev
```

This is the only command you'll need to kick off your day. It starts the **Vite dev server**, a **queue listener**, and **Pail log watcher** — all at once, in a single terminal. Open your browser and start building.

> If you're on Laravel Herd, your site is already available at `https://my-app.test` — no extra server command needed.

### Running tests

```bash
composer test          # Run the full test suite
composer test:coverage # Run with coverage report
```

Or go straight to Pest:

```bash
composer pest          # Pest with compact output
composer pest:coverage # Pest with coverage
```

### Keeping code clean

You shouldn't have to think about formatting or style — these scripts handle it for you:

```bash
composer format        # Format PHP (Pint) + frontend (Prettier) in one go
composer format:check  # Check formatting without writing any changes
composer lint          # Auto-fix PHP (Rector) + JS/TS (ESLint) issues
composer lint:check    # Check for lint issues without fixing
```

Need to target one tool specifically?

```bash
composer pint          # Format PHP code with Laravel Pint
composer pint:check    # Check PHP formatting only
composer phpstan       # Run Larastan static analysis
composer rector        # Apply Rector refactoring
composer rector:check  # Preview Rector changes without applying
composer eslint        # Run ESLint with auto-fix
composer eslint:check  # Run ESLint without fixing
```

### Pre-commit / CI review

Before pushing or opening a PR, run the full quality check in one command:

```bash
composer review
```

This runs **lint checks**, **format checks**, **tests**, and **static analysis** — everything that matters, in one pass. If it passes locally, it'll pass in CI.

### Building for production

```bash
composer build         # Build frontend assets
composer build:ssr     # Build frontend + SSR bundle (recommended for production)
```

Or use npm directly if you prefer:

```bash
npm run build
npm run build:ssr
```

### Keeping dependencies fresh

```bash
composer deps:update        # Update both Composer and npm packages together
composer update:composer    # Update Composer packages only
composer update:npm         # Update npm packages only
```

### Miscellaneous

```bash
composer logs:delete # Wipe log files from storage/logs
```

## Using Laravel Wayfinder

Wayfinder is integrated with Vite and **auto-generates** typed TypeScript helpers for all your controllers and named routes whenever you run `composer dev` or `npm run build` — no manual step required.

Import and use them in your Vue components:

```ts
import { AccountController } from '@/actions/Account/AccountController'
import { route } from '@/routes/web'
```

```vue
<!-- In a template -->
<Link :href="AccountController.edit().url()">Account</Link>
```

For the full API and advanced usage, refer to the [official Wayfinder documentation](https://github.com/laravel/wayfinder).

---

## Testing & Code Quality

Run the full test suite:

```bash
composer test
```

Filter to a specific test:

```bash
php artisan test --compact --filter=AccountController
```

Run the full quality review before pushing:

```bash
composer review
```

See [Available Scripts](#available-scripts) for the complete list of individual tool commands.

---

## Docker (Laravel Sail)

If you prefer Docker, Laravel Sail is included:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev
```

---

## Deployment

LaraVibe-Vue can be deployed to any environment that supports PHP 8.4. For the fastest path to production, use [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/).

Before deploying, build your frontend assets and run:

```bash
composer build:ssr        # build frontend + SSR bundle
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
```

---
